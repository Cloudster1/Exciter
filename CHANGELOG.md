## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A development stack (#2). `make up` starts Postgres with a streaming
  replica, Valkey, SeaweedFS, Mailpit and Keycloak on twenty ports of the
  checkout's own between 10000 and 19999, so worktrees and a Stator checkout
  run beside it; `make ports` says which. Keycloak's `suite-dev` realm has a
  client for Exciter, Armature and Stator, so a person is one subject in all
  three.
- Repository tooling (#1). `./run-tests.sh` is the one gate for every layer,
  run before each push by the branch-guard hook and in CI as a matrix of jobs;
  `release.sh` cuts a version from the commit history; issue and pull request
  templates and the GitHub workflow live in `.claude/skills/gh`.
